     Okay, so here's how it will work:
     
     - Players think of a person for each other
     - First player asks a question
     - The others will answer: YES or NO.
     - The first answer will count (maybe implement a voting system and a timer later)
     - Once there's a NO, it's the next player's turn.
     - A player can always GUESS their role instead of asking a question
     - Again, the players decide if that's accurate enough (this time by voting for sure)
     - If yes, they win and the others continue
     - If no, it's the next player's turn.
